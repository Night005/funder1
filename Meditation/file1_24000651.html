XXXIX. If so be that the Gods have deliberated in particular
of those things that should happen unto me, I must stand to
their deliberation, as discrete and wise. For that a God
should be an imprudent God, is a thing hard even to
conceive: and why should they resolve to do me hurt?
<b>for</b> what profit either unto them or the universe
(which they specially take care for) could arise from it?
But if so be that they have not deliberated of me in
particular, certainly they have of the whole in general, and
those things <b>which</b> in consequence and coherence of
this general deliberation happen unto me in particular, I am
bound to embrace and accept of. But if so be that they have
not deliberated at all (which indeed is very irreligious for
any man to believe: for then let us neither sacrifice, nor
pray, nor respect our oaths, neither let us any more use any
of those things, which we persuaded of the presence and
secret conversation of the Gods among us, daily use and
practise:) but, I say, if so be that they have not indeed
either in general, or particular deliberated of any of those
things, that happen unto us in this world; yet God be
thanked, that of those things that concern myself, it is
lawful for me to deliberate myself, and all my deliberation
is but concerning that which may be to me most profitable.
Now that unto every one is most profitable, which is
according to his own constitution <b>and</b> nature. And my
nature is, to be rational in all my actions and as a good,
and natural member of a city and commonwealth, towards my
fellow members ever to be sociably and kindly disposed and
affected. My city and country as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as
a man, the whole world. Those things therefore that are
expedient and profitable to those cities, are the only
things that are good and expedient for me.

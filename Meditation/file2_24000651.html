II. As one who is altogether governed by nature, let it be
thy care to observe what it is that thy nature in general
doth require. That done, if thou find not that thy nature,
as thou art a living sensible creature, will be the worse
for it, thou mayest proceed. Next then thou must examine,
what thy nature as thou art a living sensible creature, doth
require. And that, whatsoever it be, thou mayest admit of
and <b>do</b> it, if thy nature as thou art a reasonable
living <b>creature,</b> will not be the worse for <b>it.</b>
Now whatsoever is reasonable, is also sociable, Keep thyself
to these rules, and trouble not thyself about idle things.

XXVII. Within a while the earth shall cover us all, and then
she herself shall have her change. And then the course will
be, from one period of eternity unto another, and so a
perpetual eternity. Now can any man that shall consider with
himself in his mind the several rollings or successions of
so many changes and alterations, and <b>the</b> swiftness of
all these rulings; <b>can</b> he otherwise but contemn in
his heart and despise all <b>worldly</b> things? The cause
of the universe is as it were a strong torrent, it carrieth
all away.

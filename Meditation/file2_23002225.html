XXXII. Dost thou not see, how even those that profess
mechanic arts, though in some respect they be no better than
mere idiots, <b>yet</b> they stick close to the course of
their trade, neither can they find in their heart to decline
from it: and is it not a grievous <b>thing</b> that an
architect, or a physician shall respect the course and
mysteries of their profession, more than a man the proper
course and <b>condition</b> of his own nature, reason, which
is common to him and to the Gods?
